# Repository holding educational material for the course "DEF" 

This repo holds the [teachbook](https://design-engineering-voor-fysici.github.io/Design-Engineering-voor-Fysici-Dictaat/main/intro.html#) with all the educational material of the course "Design Engineering for Physics Students" (in Dutch: "Design Engineering voor Fysici, ie. DEF" that is taught to first year students in the physics program at Delft University of Technology.

The branch "main" contains the version at the start of the course, however, using the flexibility of teachbooks, the material is often updated (bug fixes, improvements suggested by students) while the course runs. 
When the course is active, there is a branch with a specific year to indicate that is the active branch for that year.

The online teachbook associated with this repo's main branch can be found here: [https://design-engineering-voor-fysici.github.io/Design-Engineering-voor-Fysici-Dictaat/main/intro.html](https://design-engineering-voor-fysici.github.io/Design-Engineering-voor-Fysici-Dictaat/main/intro.html).
